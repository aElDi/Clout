# Clout Antivirus

Clout Antivirus is an open-source antivirus tool that scans files for potential threats. It dynamically loads scanner modules and performs file scanning based on the loaded modules.

## Features

- Dynamic module loading: Clout Antivirus can load scanner modules dynamically from the `modules` directory.
- File scanning: It scans files for potential threats using the loaded scanner modules.
- Logging: The tool logs the scanning process and any errors encountered during initialization.

## Installation

1. Clone the Clout Antivirus repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/clout-antivirus.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

**WIP**

## Customization

You can customize Clout Antivirus by following these guidelines:

- Add or remove scanner modules: Place your scanner modules in the `modules` directory. Each module should be a Python file with a class that implements the required scanning logic.

- Modify the initialization process: Customize the `init_modules` function to suit your requirements. You can add additional checks or actions during module initialization.

- Extend the scanning functionality: Modify the `scan_file` function to include additional scanning techniques or integrate with external antivirus engines.
