# Code Documentation

## Overview
This code is a file scanning tool that uses dynamic module importing to load scanners and scan files in a specified directory.

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the required modules are installed. The code relies on the `os` and `importlib` modules, which are part of the Python standard library.

2. Place the code in a Python file with a `.py` extension.

3. Run the code by executing the Python file.

4. The code will prompt you to enter a directory to scan. Provide the path to the directory you want to scan.

5. The code will dynamically import scanner modules from the `modules` directory. It will import all Python files ending with `.py` except for `scanner.py`.

6. Each scanner module should define a class with the same name as the module. The class should have a `scan_file` method that takes a file path as an argument and returns scan data.

7. The code will iterate over all files in the specified directory and its subdirectories. For each file, it will call the `scan_file` method of each scanner module and print any detected viruses.

8. Once the scan is complete, the code will print a success message.

## Code Structure
The code consists of the following main components:

- `files_in_dir(directory)`: A generator function that recursively yields all files in a directory and its subdirectories.

- `process_file(path, scanners)`: A function that processes a file by calling the `scan_file` method of each scanner module and printing any detected viruses.

- `main()`: The main function that orchestrates the scanning process. It imports scanner modules, prompts for a directory to scan, and calls `process_file` for each file.

- `if __name__ == "__main__":` block: The entry point of the code. It calls the `main` function when the code is run as a standalone script.

## Customization
To customize the code for your needs, you can:

- Add or remove scanner modules in the `modules` directory. Each scanner module should follow the defined structure.

- Modify the file extensions or conditions for importing scanner modules in the `main` function.

- Extend the functionality of the `scan_file` method in each scanner module to perform more advanced scanning techniques.

- Modify the output format or add additional actions in the `process_file` function.

## Example Scanner Module
Here is an example of how a scanner module should be structured:

```python
# scanner_example.py

class ScannerExample:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Example Scanner"

    def scan_file(self, path):
        # Perform scanning logic here
        # Return scan data, e.g., (True, "Virus found") or (False, "No virus found")
        pass
